# Ride Guardian Desktop - Feature Restoration Tools

This collection of scripts helps restore missing or broken features in the Ride Guardian Desktop application. The scripts analyze the current state of the application, identify issues, and attempt to fix them automatically.

## üìã Included Tools

1. **`restore_features.py`** - Main restoration script that coordinates the entire process
2. **`diagnostic_test.py`** - Runs diagnostic tests to identify missing or broken features
3. **`restore_api_cache.py`** - Restores Google Maps API caching functionality
4. **`restore_excel_export.py`** - Fixes Excel/PDF export functionality
5. **`restore_ride_validation.py`** - Restores the five ride validation rules

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before running any restoration scripts, it's recommended to backup your files.

### Running the Full Restoration Process

To restore all missing features at once, run:

```bash
python restore_features.py
```

This script will:
1. Run diagnostic tests to identify issues
2. Restore each feature in the correct order
3. Run a final diagnostic test to verify the results
4. Provide a summary of the restoration process

### Running Individual Restoration Scripts

If you prefer to restore features one by one, you can run the individual scripts:

```bash
# Run diagnostic tests
python diagnostic_test.py

# Restore Google Maps API caching
python restore_api_cache.py

# Fix Excel/PDF export
python restore_excel_export.py

# Restore ride validation rules
python restore_ride_validation.py
```

## üîç Features Being Restored

### 1. Google Maps API Caching

The API caching system ensures that:
- Identical API requests are never made twice
- API requests are cached in the database
- Cache hits/misses are visually indicated in the UI
- Batch operations use the cache efficiently

### 2. Excel/PDF Export

The export system ensures that:
- Exports match the provided templates exactly
- All headers and formatting are correct
- German date/time/number formats are used
- All required fields are included

### 3. Ride Validation Rules

The five critical ride validation rules:
1. **Shift Start at Headquarters**: First ride of a shift must start at HQ
2. **Pickup Distance**: Maximum 24 minutes from HQ to pickup location
3. **Next Job Distance**: Maximum 30 minutes to next pickup, 18 minutes from previous dropoff
4. **HQ Deviation Check**: Maximum 7km deviation from direct route
5. **Time Gap Tolerance**: Maximum ¬±10 minutes between scheduled and actual times

## üìù Troubleshooting

If the automatic restoration fails, you may need to fix some issues manually. The restoration scripts will provide detailed information about what went wrong and how to fix it.

Common issues include:
- Missing files or directories
- Incompatible database schema
- Corrupted configuration files
- Incomplete implementations

## üîß Requirements

The restoration tools require:
- Python 3.6 or later
- All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Access to the application's database

## üìà Verification

After running the restoration scripts, you should:
1. Run the application: `python main.py`
2. Test each restored feature individually
3. Verify that all features work as expected
4. Check for any remaining issues

## ‚ùì Support

If you encounter any issues with the restoration process, please:
1. Check the error messages in the script output
2. Review the diagnostic test results
3. Try running the individual restoration scripts
