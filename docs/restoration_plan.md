# Ride Guardian Desktop - Feature Restoration Plan

Based on the inspection of the codebase and comparing it with the production readiness checklist, the following features need to be restored or fixed:

## 1. Google Maps API Caching System

The caching system appears to be implemented in `core/google_maps.py` but may need verification for functionality:

- **Verify Database Cache**: Ensure the `address_cache` table in the database is properly working
- **Check Visual Indicators**: Confirm `ui/components/api_cache_indicator.py` is integrated in the views
- **Validate Cache Hits/Misses**: Test with repeated routes to ensure cache hit indicators work
- **Enhance Batch Operations**: Ensure bulk route calculations use the cache effectively

## 2. Excel/PDF Export Compliance

The export system needs to be verified against the German templates:

- **Fahrtenbuch Export**: Ensure `core/enhanced_fahrtenbuch_export.py` produces exact matches to templates
- **Stundenzettel Export**: Verify timesheet exports match provided templates
- **Header Formats**: Check all German headers are exactly as specified
- **Column Ordering**: Verify the column order matches templates exactly
- **Summary Calculations**: Ensure all summary calculations at the bottom are working

## 3. Five Ride Rules Implementation

Verify all five rules are implemented and working:

- **Rule 1: Shift Start at HQ**: Check if the validation works for first ride starting at headquarters
- **Rule 2: Pickup Distance**: Verify the 24-minute rule from HQ with exception for reserved rides
- **Rule 3: Next Job Distance**: Test the 30-minute / 18-minute cascading rule
- **Rule 4: HQ Deviation**: Confirm the 7km tolerance threshold is applied
- **Rule 5: Time Gap Tolerance**: Verify the ±10 minutes tolerance is detected correctly

## 4. Payroll & Bonus Calculation

Ensure all payroll calculations are working:

- **Work Time Detection**: Verify shift detection from rides
- **Break Calculation**: Confirm break time is properly deducted
- **Bonus Types**: Check all bonuses (night, weekend, holiday) are applied
- **Minimum Wage Check**: Verify the €12.41/hour minimum is enforced

## 5. Vehicle Management

Restore vehicle management features:

- **Double Usage Prevention**: Ensure system prevents vehicle double-booking
- **Conflict Detection**: Verify conflict detection when vehicles are reassigned
- **Resolution Suggestions**: Confirm the system offers solutions for conflicts

## 6. Reporting & Analytics

Check reporting functionality:

- **Report Types**: Verify all report types (daily, weekly, monthly, annual)
- **Charts**: Ensure visualization components are working
- **Export Options**: Confirm reports can be exported in all required formats

## 7. Data Import

Validate the import system:

- **Excel Import**: Verify Uber-format Excel imports work correctly
- **Column Mapping**: Ensure the mapping system handles variations in input files
- **Validation Feedback**: Confirm users get clear feedback on import issues

## Restoration Process

1. **Perform Diagnostic Tests**:
   - Run test scripts to identify specific missing functionality
   - Check for runtime errors or UI glitches

2. **Restore Core Components First**:
   - Google Maps API caching (critical for performance)
   - Five Ride Rules (critical for business logic)
   - Excel Export (critical for compliance)

3. **Then Restore Secondary Features**:
   - Reporting and analytics
   - Vehicle conflict resolution
   - Advanced import options

4. **Validation Checks**:
   - Verify each restored feature against the production checklist
   - Ensure German translations are consistent throughout
   - Test exports against provided templates

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Perform complete workflow tests to ensure restored features work together
   - Test multi-company support with all restored features

## Implementation Priority

1. Google Maps API Caching (highest priority, affects performance)
2. Export Compliance (critical for legal requirements)
3. Five Ride Rules (core business logic)
4. Payroll Calculation (business critical)
5. Vehicle Management (operational importance)
6. Reporting (business intelligence)
7. Data Import (workflow efficiency)
